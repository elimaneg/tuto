# JAX-RS 2.0 Client API Tutorial

Examples using the new JAX-RS client API, filters, async executions and more..

To start up the RESTful webservice simply run the following command:

    make rest-server

Or alternatively if you want to clone the repo, start the day-lasting dependency download and boot the server you may also use the following command chain.

    git clone https://bitbucket.org/hascode/jaxrs2-client-tutorial.git && cd jaxrs2-client-tutorial && make rest-server


The unit tests in the client module may use this server, the configuration is adjusted to point to http://localhost:8080/tutorial/rs/book
